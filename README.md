Dice Rolling Simulator

Project Brief

The Goal of this project, like the title suggests, involves writing a program that simulates rolling a
dice. When the program runs, it will randomly choose a number between 1 and 6. (Or whatever
other integer you prefer — the number of sides on the die is up to you.) The program will print
what that number is. It should then ask you if you’d like to roll again. For this project, you’ll need
to set the min and max number that your dice can produce. For the average die, that means a
minimum of 1 and a maximum of 6. You’ll also want a function that randomly grabs a number
within that range and prints it.

Guess The Number

Project Brief

This project uses the random module in Python. The program will first randomly generate a
number unknown to the user. The user needs to guess what that number is. (In other words, the
user needs to be able to input information.) If the user’s guess is wrong, the program should
return some sort of indication as to how wrong (e.g. The number is too high or too low). If the
user guesses correctly, a positive indication should appear. You’ll need functions to check if the
user input is an actual number, to see the difference between the inputted number and the
randomly generated numbers, and to then compare the numbers.
